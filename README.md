# ML-Vehicle-Damage-Detection-System-for-Insurance-Claims
The project uses machine learning to streamline the process of identifying and assessing vehicle damage for insurance claims. By analysing images of damaged vehicles, the system automatically detects and classifies various types of damage, such as dents, scratches, or broken parts. The tool enhances the claims process by providing fast, accurate damage assessments before human intervention. This system integrates seamlessly with existing insurance platforms, improving operational efficiency and reducing the time and cost of manual damage inspections. The machine learning models, including CNNs, are trained to ensure high accuracy and reliability, providing insurers with a more efficient and automated solution for handling vehicle claims. The highest accuracy from the model training was 93.7%.
